Make: Bluetooth book's BLE Weather Station with enhancements

## Introduction

There are two improvements done to the original *BLE Weather Station* from the *Make: Bluetooth* book *(see references below)*

 1.  A tri-color LED module was added to indicate the weather: green - fair, yellow - change, and red - stormy.  This is based on the barometer.  The code for this is on the UNO.

 1. A python program was added to read the UNO's serial port and store the data in a CSV logfile so it can be plotted in Excel or another spreadsheet program.

 1. The only change to the phonegap code was to change the local location in the javascript code.
